Best Practices

- Write the selectors using lowercase letters, separate with _ (ex: .header_p for paragraphs of the header).

- Names must be descriptive.

- Selector names DON'T describe properties.

- When there is a conflict the browser picks the one with most specificity
(ex: between body {color:red} and body > p {color:blue}, it will choose the latter).

-The most specific rules go at the top of the document
