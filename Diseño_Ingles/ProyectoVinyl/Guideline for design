Vynil Record Store is a store specializing in collectible records and vinyls of all formats
and focused mainly on the 60s to 90s. We have special sections of records
Spanish and British with the rarest records you can imagine as well as a system of
disk search on request. And also, music books, comics and movie covers.
Our philosophy is to recover forgotten records and take care of them as part of the audiovisual culture.
We travel the planet to find that album you are looking for.
